Predator-Prey populations of self-replicating interstellar probes evolving on a stellar network

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dh4gan/lotka-volterra-probes.svg?token=67xANdhe8BGXTQPWepfQ&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dh4gan/lotka-volterra-probes)

This code (originally written in C++ using the Eclipse CDT) follows the growth of self-replicating interstellar probes on a network of stars.

Each star solves the Lotka-Volterra equations, where each system is coupled to neighbouring systems by inflow/outflow terms for both prey and predators.  More information can be found in the accompanying paper:

## Compiling the code ##
------------------------

This code was written in the Eclipse CDT. A standalone Makefile is also available in `\src`, so when in this directory, typing 'make' should compile the code.

## Running the code
--------------------

The code is run using the command

`> ./lotka_volterra_probes <paramfile>`

An example can be found in the `paramfiles/` directory.  The parameters that define each Lotka-Volterra system can be fixed as constants, sampled from a uniform distribution or sampled from a Gaussian.  The parameter file explains how each sampling method is defined/input into the code.

Plotting
--------

The `\plot` directory contains Python 2.7 scripts for plotting both the graph generated by the stellar network, and the individual Lotka-Volterra systems within the graph.  These were developed using numpy, scipy and matplotlib.
